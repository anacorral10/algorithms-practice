* Binary Search is a lot faster than simple Search

* O(log n) is faster the O(n), but gets a lot faster once the list f items you're searching through grows 

* Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds

* Algorithm times are measured in terms of the growth of an Algorithm

* Algorithm times are written in Big O notation
